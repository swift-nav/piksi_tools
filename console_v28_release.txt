		- logging does not begin automatically now

		- buttons to start JSON and CSV logging, allows users to choose when to begin logging
		- set logging location from command line 
	- Toggle button to make legend in the Tracking Tab visible
	- Legend in Tracking Tab is now smaller and does not hide the satellite signals
	- Added auto-survey button for the surveyed lat, lon and alt positions in the Settings Tab
