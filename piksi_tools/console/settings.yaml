- group: surveyed_position
  name: broadcast
  expert: false
  type: boolean
  units:
  default value: 'False'
  readonly: false
  enumerated possible values: True,False
  Description: Broadcast surveyed base station position.
  Notes: This flag ultimately determines whether the SBP message with identifier
    MSG_BASE_POS_ECEF will be calculated and sent.  Logically, setting this attribute to
    "true" sets the Local receiver as a base station and configures the unit to send
    its surveyed position coordinates to the other receiver(s) with which the base
    station is communicating.  If "true", the remote receiver that receives the
    surveyed position will calculate and communicate a pseudo absolute
    RTK position based upon the received position.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_lat
  expert: false
  type: Double
  units: degrees
  default value: '0'
  readonly: false
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Surveyed latitude of the antenna.
  Notes: This setting represents the latitude of the local receiver's antenna, expressed
    in decimal degrees relative to the equator (north = positive, south = negative).
    If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", the coordinate will be
    communicated to remote receivers for use in calculating their pseudo-absolute
    RTK position. The value should be as accurate as possible and should have
    precision to at least 7 digits following the decimal point. For reference,
    1e-7 degrees of latitude is about 1.1 cm on the surface of the earth. Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the remote receiver.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_lon
  expert: false
  type: Double
  units: degrees
  default value: '0'
  readonly: false
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Surveyed longitude of the antenna.
  Notes: This setting represents the longitude of the local receiver's antenna, expressed
    in decimal degrees relative to the Prime Meridian (east = positive, west = negative).
    If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", the coordinate will be
    communicated to remote receivers for use in calculating their pseudo-absolute
    RTK position. The value should be as accurate as possible and should have
    precision to at least 7 digits following the decimal point. For reference,
    1e-7 degrees of longitude at 35 degree latitude is about 1 cm.  Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the remote receiver.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_alt
  expert: false
  type: Double
  units: meters
  default value: '0'
  readonly: false
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Surveyed altitude of the antenna.
  Notes: This setting represents the altitude of the receiver's antenna above the
    WGS84 ellipsoid, in meters. If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true",
    this coordinate will be communicated to remote receivers for use in calculating
    their pseudo-absolute position. This value should be precise to 1 cm. Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the Rover.

- group: frontend
  expert: false
  name: antenna_selection
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Primary'
  readonly: false
  enumerated possible values: Primary,Secondary
  Description: Determines which antenna to use.
  Notes: This setting selects the antenna input that should be used by the receiver.
    Piksi Multi boards and Duro units ship with only a "Primary" antenna connector,
    so this should always be set to "Primary."

- group: frontend
  name: antenna_bias
  expert: false
  type: bool
  units: N/A
  default value: 'True'
  readonly: false
  Description: Enable/Disable 4.85V antenna bias.
  Notes: Most active antennas require an antenna bias in order to power
    the amplifier in the antenna.

- group: sbp
  name: obs_msg_max_size
  expert: true
  type: integer
  units: bytes
  default value: '255'
  readonly: false
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Determines the maximum message length for raw observation sbp messages.
  Notes: This parameter is useful for tuning observation messages for compatibility
    with radio modems.  Some serial modems will internally split serial packets for
    their protocol and this parameter allows the size of the message to be reduced
    as to prevent the modem from sending multiple packets. If the parameter exceeds
    255 bytes (the maximum size of an SBP message), the receiver firmware will ignore
    the parameter and use 255 bytes.  If the parameter is set smaller than the size
    of one observation, the firmware will ignore the parameter and use the size
    of one observation as the maximum message size.

- group: simulator

  name: enabled

    stationary base station and the Local receiver moving in a circle around the
    base station. The simulator is intended to aid in system integration by
    providing realistic looking outputs but does not faithfully simulate every
    aspect of device operation.

    be output.
  Notes: For instance, if the solution frequency (soln_freq) is 10 Hz, and the output_every_n_obs
    setting is 10, it means that the observation output will occur at a rate
    of 1 Hz. This parameter is designed to tune the rate at which correction information is passed 
    from one receiver to the other as to efficiently use radio modem bandwidth and fit with user applications.

- group: solution
  name: dgnss_solution_mode
  expert: false
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Low Latency'
  readonly: false
  enumerated possible values: Low Latency, Time Matched, No DGNSS
  Description: Selects the type of RTK solution to output.
  Notes: A "Low Latency" solution uses an internal model of anticipated satellite observations
    to provide RTK output with minimal latency but slightly reduced accuracy. "Low Latency" mode
    assumes that the base station is stationary. For applications where accuracy is desired over timeliness
    or when both receivers are moving, "Time Matched" mode should be chosen. This
    means that the RTK output will require a corresponding set of correction observations
    for each timestamp. When "No DGNSS" is chosen, no differential output will be
    attempted by the receiver.

- group: solution
  name: dgnss_filter
  expert: true
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Fixed'
  readonly: false
  enumerated possible values: Fixed,Float
  Description: Determines the type of carrier phase ambiguity resolution that the receiver will attempt to achieve.
  Notes: If "fixed", the receiver will output a integer fixed ambiguity estimate.  If
    no fixed solution is available, it will revert to the float solution.  If "float",
    the device will only output the float ambiguity estimate.
    This settings is not used by Piksi Multi and Duro.

    "SBP" configures the interface to transmit messages specified in the 'enabled_sbp_messages' setting and to receive incoming SBP messages. If the mode is changed from SBP the console will no longer be able to communicate over the interface.

    "NMEA OUT" configures the interface to transmit the GGA, RMC, GGL, VTG, ZDA, GSA, and GSV NMEA 0183 messages. The interface will not receive incoming messages.

    "RTCMv3.1 IN" configures the interface to receive RTK corrections in RTCM format. The interface will receive 1002, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1010, and 1012 RTCMv3.1 messages and will not transmit or receive any other messages.

  Description: Communication protocol for TCP server 0.
  Notes: |
    "SBP" configures the interface to transmit messages specified in the 'enabled_sbp_messages' setting and to receive incoming SBP messages. If the mode is changed from SBP the console will no longer be able to communicate over the interface.

    "NMEA OUT" configures the interface to transmit the GGA, RMC, GGL, VTG, ZDA, GSA, and GSV NMEA 0183 messages. The interface will not receive incoming messages.

    "RTCMv3.1 IN" configures the interface to receive RTK corrections in RTCM format. The interface will receive 1002, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1010, and 1012 RTCMv3.1 messages and will not transmit or receive any other messages.

  Description: Configure which messages should be sent on the port.
  Notes: The enabled sbp messages settings is a list of message types
    and rate divisors that will be sent out of the interface. If left blank, all
    messages will be sent. If not blank, a comma separated list of
    SBP message IDs in base 10 integer format should be provided.  Optionally,
    a divisor can be specified after the / character for each id.  For example, an entry of
    3456/10 would provide message with ID 3456 at 1/10th the normal rate.  For Ethernet,
    the default value is optimal for logging and communication with the console.
