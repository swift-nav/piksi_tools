- group: surveyed_position
  name: broadcast
  type: boolean
  units:
  default value: 'False'
  enumerated possible values: true,false
  Description: Broadcast surveyed base station location
  Notes: This flag ultimately determines whether the SBP message with identifier
    MSG_BASE_POS_ECEF will be calculated and sent.  Logically, setting this attribute to
    "true" sets the Local Piksi as a base station and configures the unit to send
    its surveyed location coordinates to the other Piksi(s) with which the base
    station is communicating.  If "true", the remote Piksi that receives the
    surveyed position will calculate and communicate a pseudo absolute
    RTK position based upon the received position.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_lat
  type: Double
  units: degrees
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed latitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the latitude of the local Piksi's antenna, expressed
    in decimal degrees relative to the equator (north = positive, south = negative).
    If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", the coordinate will be
    communicated to remote Piksis for use in calculating their pseudo-absolute
    RTK position. The value should be as accurate as possible and should have
    precision to at least 7 digits following the decimal point. For reference,
    1e-7 degrees of latitude is about 1.1 cm on the surface of the earth. Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the remote Piksi.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_lon
  type: Double
  units: degrees
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed longitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the longitude of the local Piksi's antenna, expressed
    in decimal degrees relative to the Prime Meridian (east = positive, west = negative).
    If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", the coordinate will be
    communicated to remote Piksis for use in calculating their pseudo-absolute
    RTK position. The value should be as accurate as possible and should have
    precision to at least 7 digits following the decimal point. For reference,
    1e-7 degrees of longitude at 35 degree latitude is about 1 cm.  Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the remote Piksi.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_alt
  type: Double
  units: meters
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed altitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the altitude of the Piksi's antenna above the
    WGS84 ellipsoid, in meters. If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true",
    this coordinate will be communicated to remote Piksis for use in calculating
    their pseudo-absolute position. This value should be precise to 1 cm. Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the Rover.

- group: frontend
  name: antenna_selection
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Primary'
  enumerated possible values: Primary,Secondary
  Description: Determines which antenna to use.
  Notes: This setting selects the antenna input that should be used by the Piksi.
    Most Piksi Multi boards ship with only a "Primary" antenna connector, so this should
    always be set to "Primary."

- group: frontend
  name: antenna_bias
  type: bool
  units: N/A
  default value: 'True'
  Description: Enable/Disable 5 V antenna bias.
  Notes: Most active antennas require an antenna bias in order to power
    the amplifier in the antenna.

- group: sbp
  name: obs_msg_max_size
  type: integer
  units: bytes
  default value: '102'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Determines the maximum message length for raw observation sbp messages.
  Notes: This parameter is useful for tuning observation messages for compatibility
    with radio modems.  Some serial modems will internally split serial packets for
    their protocol and this parameter allows the size of the message to be reduced
    as to prevent the modem from sending multiple packets. If the parameter exceeds
    255 bytes (the maximum size of an SBP message), the Piksi firmware will ignore
    the parameter and use 255 bytes.  If the parameter is set smaller than the size
    of one observation, the Piksi firmware will ignore the parameter and use the size
    of one observation as the maximum message size.

- group: simulator

    stationary base station and the Local Piksi moving in a circle around the
    base station The simulator is intended to aid in system integration by
    providing realistic looking outputs but does not faithfully simulate every
    aspect of device operation.

  Notes:

- group: solution
  name: output_every_n_obs
  type: integer
  units: N/A
  default value: '2'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Integer divisor of solution frequency for which the observations will
    be output.
  Notes: For instance, if the solution frequency is 10 Hz, and the "output every n
    obs" parameter is 2, it means that the observation output will occur at a rate
    of 5 Hz.  Since the observations are the information used by the Piksi receiving
    corrections from the connected Piksi, this determines the rate of information
    sharing for RTK solution output. This parameter is designed to tune the rate at
    which correction information is passed from one Piksi to the other as to efficiently
    use radio modem bandwidth and fit with user applications.

- group: solution
  name: dgnss_solution_mode
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Low Latency'
  enumerated possible values: Low Latency, Time Matched, No DGNSS
  Description: Selects the type of RTK solution to output.
  Notes: A "Low Latency" solution uses an internal model of anticipated satellite observations
    to provide RTK output with minimal latency but slightly reduced accuracy. "Low Latency" mode
    assumes that the base station is stationary. For applications where accuracy is desired over timelieness
    or when both Piksi's are moving, "Time matched" mode can be chosen. This
    means that the RTK output will require a corresponding set of correction observations
    for each timestamp. When "No DGNSS" is chosen, no differential output will be
    attempted by Piksi.

- group: solution
  name: dgnss_filter
  expert: true
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Fixed'
  enumerated possible values: Fixed,Float
  Description: Determines the type of carrier phase ambiguity resolution that the Piksi will attempt to achieve.
  Notes: If "fixed", the Piksi will output a integer fixed ambiguity estimate.  If
    no fixed solution is available, it will revert to the float solution.  If "float",
    the device will only output the float ambiguity estimate.
    This settings is not used by Piksi Multi.

  Description: The netmask for the IP config.
  Notes: The configured netmask in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format.

- group: ethernet
  name: gateway
  type: string
  units: N/A
  default value: '192.168.0.1'
  Description: The default gateway for the IP config.
  Notes: The configured gateway in XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX format.

- group: ethernet
  name: enabled_sbp_messages
  type: string
  units: N/A
  default value: 'blank - all messages are enabled'
  Description: Configure which messages should be sent on the port
  Notes: The enabled sbp messages settings is a list of message types
    and rate divisors that will be sent out of the interface. If left blank, all
    messages will be sent. If not blank, a comma separated list of
    SBP message IDs in base 10 integer format should be provided.  Optionally,
    a divisor can be specified after the / character for each id.  For example, an entry of
    3456/10 would provide message with ID 3456 at 1/10th the normal rate.  For Ethernet,
    the default value is optimal for logging and communication with the console.

  default value: '50'
  enumerated possible values: 25,50,100,200
  units: Hz
  description: The data rate (in Hz) for IMU raw output
  Notes: It is recommended to use Ethernet or USB for IMU data output
    for data rates over 25 Hz

- group: imu
  name: acc_range
  type: enum
  default value: '2'
  enumerated possible values: 2,4,8,16
  units: g
  description: the approximate range of accelerations that can be measured
  Notes: When 2 g is chosen, it means the accelerometer is scaled to measure
    about +/- 2 g of acceleration. Refer to the IMU datasheet for detailed information.

  description: the approximate range of angular rate that can be measured
  Notes: When 125 is chosen, it means the gyro is scaled to measure
    about +/- 125 deg/s of angular rate. Refer to the IMU datasheet for detailed information.
