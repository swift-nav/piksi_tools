- group: surveyed_position
  name: broadcast
  expert: false
  type: boolean
  units:
  default value: 'False'
  enumerated possible values: true,false
  Description: Broadcast surveyed base station position
  Notes: This flag ultimately determines whether the SBP message with identifier
    MSG_BASE_POS_ECEF will be calculated and sent.  Logically, setting this attribute to
    "true" sets the Local Piksi as a base station and configures the unit to send
    its surveyed position coordinates to the other Piksi(s) with which the base
    station is communicating.  If "true", the remote Piksi that receives the
    surveyed position will calculate and communicate a pseudo absolute
    RTK position based upon the received position.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_lat
  expert: false
  type: Double
  units: degrees
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed latitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the latitude of the local Piksi's antenna, expressed
    in decimal degrees relative to the equator (north = positive, south = negative).
    If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", the coordinate will be
    communicated to remote Piksis for use in calculating their pseudo-absolute
    RTK position. The value should be as accurate as possible and should have
    precision to at least 7 digits following the decimal point. For reference,
    1e-7 degrees of latitude is about 1.1 cm on the surface of the earth. Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the remote Piksi.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_lon
  expert: false
  type: Double
  units: degrees
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed longitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the longitude of the local Piksi's antenna, expressed
    in decimal degrees relative to the Prime Meridian (east = positive, west = negative).
    If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", the coordinate will be
    communicated to remote Piksis for use in calculating their pseudo-absolute
    RTK position. The value should be as accurate as possible and should have
    precision to at least 7 digits following the decimal point. For reference,
    1e-7 degrees of longitude at 35 degree latitude is about 1 cm.  Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the remote Piksi.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_alt
  expert: false
  type: Double
  units: meters
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed altitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the altitude of the Piksi's antenna above the
    WGS84 ellipsoid, in meters. If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true",
    this coordinate will be communicated to remote Piksis for use in calculating
    their pseudo-absolute position. This value should be precise to 1 cm. Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the Rover.

- group: frontend
  expert: false
  name: antenna_selection
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Primary'
  enumerated possible values: Primary,Secondary
  Description: Determines which antenna to use
  Notes: This setting selects the antenna input that should be used by the Piksi.
    Most Piksi Multi boards ship with only a "Primary" antenna connector, so this should
    always be set to "Primary."

- group: frontend
  name: antenna_bias
  expert: false
  type: bool
  units: N/A
  default value: 'True'
  Description: Enable/Disable 4.85V antenna bias
  Notes: Most active antennas require an antenna bias in order to power
    the amplifier in the antenna.

- group: sbp
  name: obs_msg_max_size
  expert: false
  type: integer
  units: bytes
  default value: '102'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Determines the maximum message length for raw observation sbp messages
  Notes: This parameter is useful for tuning observation messages for compatibility
    with radio modems.  Some serial modems will internally split serial packets for
    their protocol and this parameter allows the size of the message to be reduced
    as to prevent the modem from sending multiple packets. If the parameter exceeds
    255 bytes (the maximum size of an SBP message), the Piksi firmware will ignore
    the parameter and use 255 bytes.  If the parameter is set smaller than the size
    of one observation, the Piksi firmware will ignore the parameter and use the size
    of one observation as the maximum message size.

  expert: false
  type: integer
  units: N/A
  default value: '10'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Integer divisor of solution frequency for which the observations will
    be output
  Notes: For instance, if the solution frequency (soln_freq) is 10 Hz, and the output_every_n_obs
    setting is 10, it means that the observation output will occur at a rate
    of 1 Hz.  Since the observations are the information used by the Piksi receiving
    corrections from the connected Piksi, this determines the rate of information
    sharing for RTK solution output. This parameter is designed to tune the rate at
    which correction information is passed from one Piksi to the other as to efficiently
    use radio modem bandwidth and fit with user applications.

- group: solution
  name: dgnss_solution_mode
  expert: false
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Low Latency'
  enumerated possible values: Low Latency, Time Matched, No DGNSS
  Description: Selects the type of RTK solution to output
  Notes: A "Low Latency" solution uses an internal model of anticipated satellite observations
    to provide RTK output with minimal latency but slightly reduced accuracy. "Low Latency" mode
    assumes that the base station is stationary. For applications where accuracy is desired over timeliness
    or when both Piksi's are moving, "Time Matched" mode can be chosen. This
    means that the RTK output will require a corresponding set of correction observations
    for each timestamp. When "No DGNSS" is chosen, no differential output will be
    attempted by Piksi.

- group: solution
  name: dgnss_filter
  expert: true
  type: enum
  units: N/A
  default value: 'Fixed'
  enumerated possible values: Fixed,Float
  Description: Determines the type of carrier phase ambiguity resolution that the Piksi will attempt to achieve
  Notes: If "fixed", the Piksi will output a integer fixed ambiguity estimate.  If
    no fixed solution is available, it will revert to the float solution.  If "float",
    the device will only output the float ambiguity estimate.
    This settings is not used by Piksi Multi.

  Description: Communication protocol for tcp server 0 (port 55555) 
  Notes: |
    "SBP" configures the interface to transmit messages specified in the 'enabled_sbp_messages' setting and to receive incoming SBP messages. If the mode is changed from SBP the console will no longer be able to communicate over the interface.
    
    "NMEA OUT" configures the interface to transmit the GGA, RMC, GGL, VTG, ZDA, GSA, and GSV NMEA 0183 messages. The interface will not receive incoming messages. 
    
    "RTCMv3.1 IN" configures the interface to receive RTK corrections in RTCM format. The interface will receive 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006 and 1007 RTCMv3.1 messages and will not transmit or receive any other messages.

    messages will be sent. If not blank, a comma separated list of
    SBP message IDs in base 10 integer format should be provided.  Optionally,
    a divisor can be specified after the / character for each id.  For example, an entry of
    3456/10 would provide message with ID 3456 at 1/10th the normal rate.  For Ethernet,
    the default value is optimal for logging and communication with the console.
